    "1. The data might not be normally distributed; meaining there might inherently be more data during summer months than fall months for example, and  this should not affect the predictions. Frequency of crime across all months should be considered in our model.\n",
    "2. Weather information; we have datetime and location of crimes reported. We can either simply infer seasons based on this, or we can make it more complex by querying weather data for datetime and location. This is a simple operation that queries national weather data for a zipcode and date using the API like https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/data?datasetid=GHCND&locationid=ZIP:28801&startdate=2010-05-01&enddate=2010-05-01"

The method of sampling data would be modified so that if we sample 20 random dates from each month from 2020-2023 all the dates that don't have a crime report will have NO_CRIME as label. This will ensure that we account for crime frequency in certain months over others.\n",
